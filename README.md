Project Z:

PvE/PvP Dungeon Crawler

Story -
Project Z’s story is still TBD

Gameplay -
Project Z features a dungeon crawler similar to WoW Classic, in that you work your way up to large and hard raids collecting gear, and talent tree additions along the way. Project Z will have randomized dungeons and non-randomized dungeons when necessary. Randomized dungeons will be used for replayability and gear randomness. Non-Randomized dungeons are necessary for large boss fights and dungeons. The biggest difference between this game and others is that, if a player dies while playing they lose all gear they have brought with them or collected in that level. HOWEVER, the player will not lose levels or talent tree points acquired along the way. This way there is a Risk V.S. Reward in Project Z, where the high-end levels require high-end gear to complete but are much riskier. After completing a majority of the game players can PvP each other. In PvP players compete by racing through the same dungeon. Any gear the player is wearing is “gambled”. When one player loses that player loses all the gear they brought with them to the dungeon and SOME of the gear is given to the other player who won. Only some gear is given to ensure that no “gear inflation” happens. Each gear piece has a rough 25% chance of breaking, this means if it breaks it will not be given to the other player. The incentive to win PvP is a leaderboard. Players who reach a certain rank will achieve certain rewards depending on their rank. To ensure the player that brings better gear will not win all the time, my goal with Project Z is to always have Skill be more influential than Gear. To do this the player must understand the class to its completion.

Levels -
There are 3 different types of levels in Project Z. The first type is called Random. In this type, all gear is randomized up to a “cap” to prevent the best gear from dropping (reserved for bosses). This is where at the beginning of the game a majority of players will spend most of their time. This type of level is all randomly generated to ensure replayability. At the end of each level will include a mini-boss for the player to defeat for extra gear. If the player dies along the way all gear they have brought with them is lost. After some gear from these levels, the next level is Dungeons. Dungeons are large boss fights that require more skill and research than Random. The final tier is Raid. In raids, the player faces the greatest challenge. Exclusive hard bosses that are only reserved for raids. These raids require intense research, practice, and dedication. These raids will drop some of the best gear in the game.

Updates -
Because there is a lot of moving parts in Project Z, many things can constantly be updated including, but not limited to: balance between classes, new classes, balance in talent trees, new talent trees, new bosses, new gear. This way the game will always bring something new even for the most hardcore players.

Classes -
Project Z will have a class-based system with “sub-classes” stemming from these. While the Main class will be the most influential, you can still change certain aspects using the Talent tree to build your own version of the class. 

Talent Tree -
The talent tree will work very similarly to WoW Classic’s talent tree system. (Screenshot below)

In this system, a player can choose a sub-class of the main class that each dives deep into a certain aspect of the class. For example, the class Deal Sealer is a card thrower. One talent focuses on the rapid fire of the classes, while another would turn you into a hard hitter that does more damage but slower firing speed. Each time you level up you will get a point to put into the talent tree. However, some sections of the talent tree must be found (like gear).
